### Notes
* I haven't implemented a main entrypoint for the task it just has tools that
  can be used. 
* Spent 2 hours on it so far and wasted 20-30 mins refactoring to use price
  rather than decimal, which was probably the wrong decision.
* I'll make a branch off main where I'll continue with the task adding CLI
  interaction because I'm invested in it now and enjoying myself.
* This branch is called additional-features if you wish to take a look at it.
  Overall I was unhappy with my performance in the 2 hour window which has
  also been a driving factor in the further changes. It's also just a fun
  problem to solve.
